<p> Morgan Cole Wallen is the son of Lesli Wallen and Tommy Wallen. He was raised in the small town of Sneedville, Tennessee. Throughout his childhood, Wallen took piano and violin lessons and enjoyed playing music and singing in church. He played baseball while in school, but an injury forced him to give up his baseball dreams. His mom signed him up for The Voice where he was a contestant on Team Usher and Team Levine. Following his time on the NBC competition show, Morgan Wallen signed with Panacea records for a short time. He later signed with Big Loud Records and released his official debut single, “The Way I Talk.” His debut album, If I know Me, was officially released on April 27, 2018. The project spawned country music hits like “Whiskey Glasses” and “Up Down.” </p>
